# 'To Do' Lists

Below is a UML diagram showing classes that collectively implement a simple
'To Do' list.

  class ToDoList {
    size : Int [computed]
    notStarted : Int [computed]

    overdue : Int [computed]
    load(filename: String)

    getItems(status: ItemStatus?) List~ToDoItem~
    getItemsDueOn(date: LocalDate) List~ToDoItem~
  }
```

## Discussion

A `ToDoItem` has a due date, a current status and a description of the item.
It overrides `toString()` to provide a string representation including these
three properties, separated by a colon and a space, e.g.,

    2026-10-16: Done: Fix bike puncture

`ToDoItem` also has an `isOverdue()` method that returns `true` if the due
date comes before today's date, otherwise `false`.

A `ToDoList` is an aggregation of `ToDoItem` objects. It has a set of
computed properties that give the size of the list, the number of items with
a status of `NotStarted`, the number of items with a status of `InProgress`,
the number of items with a status of `Done`, and the number of items that
are overdue.

`ToDoList` also provides methods to load a list from a file, and save it to
a file. See `to-do.csv` in `to-do-list/data/` for an example of the required
format.

Invoking the primary constructor of `ToDoList` gives you an empty list,
to which you can add items using the `add()` method. This accepts a variable
number of `ToDoItem` objects as its argument (minimum of 1).

The `deleteDone()` method of `ToDoList` removes any items with a status of
`Done`. It returns `true` if any items were actually removed, otherwise `false`.

The `getItems()` method can be called with one of the `ItemStatus` enum values
or `null` as an argument, `null` being the default. If the argument is `null`,
it will return all of the items as a `List<ToDoItem>` object; if the argument
is one of the `ItemStatus` enum values, it will return just the items with
that status, as a `List<ToDoItem>` object.

`getItemsDueOn()` takes a `LocalDate` object as its only argument and returns
a `List<ToDoItem>` object containing all the items whose due date matches
the given date.

## Your Task

We have provided incomplete code for the classes in the diagram above, along
with a small demo program, in subdirectory `to-do-list/src`. **Spend some
time examining these source files carefully.** If there is anything you don't
understand about these files, please ask for help in one of your timetabled
lab sessions.

The first step is to run the tests for these classes, with

    ./kotlin test -m to-do-list

You will notice a number of failures. This is because some of features of
`ToDoList` are stubs rather than proper implementations. The stubbed
features are

- `notStarted` computed property
- `inProgress` computed property
- `done` computed property
- `overdue` computed property
- `load()` method
- `deleteDone()` method
- `getItems()` method
- `getItemsDueOn()` method

Edit `to-do-list/src/ToDoList.kt` and replace these stubs with the correct
implementations. When all 13 of the tests pass and no failures are reported,
you will have completed this part of the assignment successfully. (You will
see some messages about skipped tests, but you can ignore those.)

**Note that many of these stubbed properties and methods can be implemented
using a single line of code**, so you are not being asked to do a huge amount
of work here!

You will definitely find the discussion of [Lambdas & Collections][sec83]
useful if you are seeking a concise solution.

## Demo Program

As a further informal test of your solution, you can try running the demo
program that we've included in the source files. This requires a CSV filename
and a date to be supplied as command line arguments. Here's an example of
how you can run it:

    ./kotlin run -m to-do-list to-do-list/data/to-do.csv 2026-10-16
